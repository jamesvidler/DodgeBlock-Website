This is a trippy and challenging endless runner/flyer, inspired by classic arcade games and re-imagined for VR using procedural generation. Dodge the blocks and fly through the rings to extend your time. No two runs are ever the same. How long can you last?" />

      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.
